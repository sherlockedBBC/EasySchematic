/**
 * The single scalar objective for auto-routing quality — LOWER IS BETTER.
 *
 * This is the scoring oracle for the portfolio search: every routing candidate is reduced to one
 * number via `routingScore`, and the search keeps the minimum. It's deliberately a pure function of
 * the metric record that `computeRuleReport` (routingHarness/metrics.ts) already produces, so the
 * harness and (later) the in-worker scorer share one definition of "clean."
 *
 * Weighting rationale (from the routing research + project aesthetics notes):
 *   - HARD-ZERO violations (route through a device, non-orthogonal segment, unrouted edge) must
 *     never be traded for cosmetics — they get an enormous weight so any candidate with one always
 *     loses to a candidate without. They are correctness, not aesthetics.
 *   - WEAVING (a pair of edges crossing each other ≥2× — back-and-forth) is the headline ugliness
 *     and the user's stated complaint; weighted hardest among soft metrics.
 *   - SHARED-PARALLEL (overlapping/co-running segments — "shared verticals worst") and CROSS-TYPE
 *     under-separation rank just below weaving.
 *   - A single clean ORTHOGONAL CROSSING reads fine (graph-drawing literature) — weighted light, so
 *     the search doesn't contort a layout to shave one right-angle crossing at the cost of a weave.
 *   - NON-HORIZONTAL ARRIVALS, BACKWARD SEGMENTS, BENDS (turns), DETOUR (wire length), and FALLBACK
 *     routes get moderate weights.
 *
 * Diagnostic-only metrics (channelDensity, distinctTrackXs, doglegCount) are NOT scored.

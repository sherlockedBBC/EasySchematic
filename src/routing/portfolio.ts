/**
 * Portfolio search candidate set + winner selection.
 *
 * The router has no single best configuration — the optimum is per-schematic (measured: icdc/video
 * want crossing-penalty 12, ARKEMA wants 30; the dense-optimal sort/turn settings regress the
 * backward-edges case). So instead of re-tuning one global default, we route a small DIVERSIFIED set
 * of candidates and keep the cleanest by the objective (src/routing/objective.ts).
 *
 * A candidate is just a `__routingParams` override object (the live-tuning hook ROUTER_PARAMS /
 * ROUTING_PARAMS already read). That makes a candidate trivially serializable to a worker (the
 * routing worker already re-applies `req.routingParams`), so the same set drives the offline harness
 * and the in-browser worker pool.
 *
 * INVARIANT: the first candidate is the current shipped DEFAULT (empty override). Because the search
 * keeps the best and ties resolve to the earliest candidate, best-of-portfolio is NEVER worse than
 * today on any schematic, and an unchanged schematic stays on the default — the zero-regression /
 * stability guarantee.

## Features

### Canvas & Devices

- **2,000+ device templates** drawn from the [community device library](https://devices.easyschematic.live) — fetched live when you're online, with a bundled offline fallback so the app stays usable without a connection
- **User templates** — save modified devices as reusable templates
- **Favorite devices** — star templates in the library for quick access; favorites pin to the top and sort first in search
- **Template presets** — save a device configuration as the project default for that template; new placements auto-apply the preset
- **Quick-add** — double-click empty canvas to open a search dialog; type to find any device, note, or room and place it instantly
- **Signal type filter** — narrow device search to templates exposing a chosen signal type, in both the app and the devices site
- **Expansion slots** — devices with swappable card bays (e.g. router chassis with SDI/HDMI/fiber cards); right-click a slot to swap cards in or out, or build a custom card from scratch
- **Custom devices** — design any device from scratch with a guided builder (matrix routers, breakout panels, anything with structured I/O sections)
- **Notes & annotations** — text annotations on the canvas with rectangle and ellipse shapes
- **Rooms** — resizable dashed-border containers for grouping devices, with lock/unlock to prevent accidental moves
- **Auto-numbering** — dropped devices auto-increment (Camera → Camera 1, Camera 2, …)
- **Dark mode** — toggle light/dark themes from the menu bar; saved automatically, respects OS setting on first visit
- **Mobile support** — mobile detection with hamburger menu and touch-friendly pan controls
- **Physical dimensions** — height, width, depth (mm) and weight (kg) fields on devices
- **Auxiliary data block** — up to 5 custom lines at the bottom of a device, either free text or bound to device properties (hostname, power, weight, port counts, etc.) via a `{{field}}` picker that keeps values in sync automatically
- **Custom label expansion** — embed `{{cableId}}` and other tokens in device labels for inline cable references
- **IO counts** — optional badges on devices showing connected/total ports per direction (View Options)
- **Hostname** — per-device hostname field, feeding into the network report
- **Venue-provided gear flag** — mark devices as provided by venue; distinguished in the pack list
- **Owned Gear library** — track an inventory of gear you own; the pack list reports used vs. needed counts so you know what to buy or rent
- **Nested slots** — expansion cards with their own sub-slots (e.g., SFP/QSFP transceivers in network cards)

### Connections

- **Click-to-connect** — click a source handle, preview line follows cursor, snaps to nearby valid targets (green = valid, red = incompatible signal type), click target to connect or click device body to auto-connect first compatible port
- **Drag-to-connect** with the same preview/snap/validity behavior
- **Network ports connect in any direction** — Ethernet, Dante, NDI, and other network signal types allow input-to-input and output-to-output connections
- **Smart edge routing** — A\* pathfinding avoids device crossings with automatic parallel edge nesting
- **Auto-route toggle** — disable A\* routing for lag-free editing on large schematics; click the status chip in the top-right corner
- **Manual route editing** — right-click a connection to add draggable waypoints; A\* routes each leg between waypoints while other connections yield
- **Cable length** — editable per-connection field, tracked in cable schedule and pack list
- **Estimated cable length** — auto-populated from room-to-room distances when both endpoints are inside placed rooms; flows into the cable schedule, patch panel schedule, and pack list
- **Multicable support** — cable accessory templates (snakes, socapex), trunk ports, break-in/break-out devices
- **Cable ID labels** — auto-assigned with type-prefix naming (e.g. "SDI-1", "HDMI-2") or sequential ("Cable 1", "Cable 2")
- **Line jump arcs** at connection crossings
- **Stubbed connections** — render as short stubs with destination labels (device name, room, page) instead of full routed lines; drag labels to reposition, add intermediate waypoints via right-click
- **Connector mismatch override** — force-connect ports with incompatible connectors
- **Bare wire compatibility** — Phoenix and Terminal Block connectors connect to any connector type without adapter warnings
- **68 signal types**, all color-coded (see below)
- **Connection line styles** — solid, dashed, dotted, or dash-dot per connection or per signal type
- **Adapters** — automatic adapter insertion between incompatible ports, with direct-attach support, barrels, gender labels, and per-adapter visibility controls

### Ports

- Input, output, and **bidirectional** directions
- **Port sections** — group related ports under headers
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** in the device editor
- Add, remove, and rename ports per device
- **Port notes** — optional notes field per port for documenting specific usage
- **Flip ports** — move any port to the opposite side of the device for flexible signal flow layouts
- **Connector gender** — auto-derived from connector type and direction, with per-port overrides for connectors where gender varies (XLR, powerCON, IEC, Cam-Lok, BNC, TRS). The cable schedule adds an `M-M` or `F-F` suffix to cables that need two like-gendered plugs, so pack lists reflect what you actually need to buy.
- **Patch panels** — devices with `patch-panel` type render as front/rear instead of input/output, with column headers on the canvas; built-in templates for RJ45, BNC, XLR, fiber LC, and TT bantam patch bays in common port counts

### Organization

- **Snap-to-alignment guides** while dragging
- **Alignment operations** — left, center, right, top, middle, bottom
- **Distribution** — horizontal/vertical even spacing
- **MiniMap** and zoom controls
- **Grid snapping** (20px)
- **Room snap guides** — rooms and resize handles snap to other rooms' edges/centers with visible alignment guides
- **Room styling** — right-click a room to set background color, border color, border style, and label size
- **Space + drag** to pan (Vectorworks-style)
- **Subrooms** — nested room containers for representing locations within locations (e.g., rack bays inside a control room)
- **Equipment racks** — mark a room as an equipment rack via right-click for rack-style rendering
- **Shift+click toggle selection** — add/remove items from selection; Shift+drag for AutoCAD-style directional selection

- Layout preferences saved per-schematic
- **BOM cost tracking** — unit cost field on devices and cables for budgeting

### Community Device Database

- **[devices.easyschematic.live](https://devices.easyschematic.live)** — browse, search, and submit device templates
- **Community submissions** — submit new devices or suggest edits to existing templates via magic-link email auth
- **Submit from the canvas** — right-click any device and choose "Submit to Community" to seed a submission with all the fields you've already filled in, instead of re-entering them on the devices site
- **Moderation workflow** — submissions are reviewed by moderators before going live
- **Reference URLs** — branded devices link to manufacturer product pages for spec verification
- **Contributor attribution** — approved submissions credit the contributor on the device page and the hall of fame
- **REST API** at `api.easyschematic.live` backed by Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) — open for read access, no auth required

#### Public API

If you're building AV tooling and need a structured database of professional audiovisual equipment with port definitions, signal types, and connector types, help yourself:

- `GET https://api.easyschematic.live/templates` — all device templates
- `GET https://api.easyschematic.live/templates/:id` — single template with contributor attribution

Responses are JSON, cached for 5 minutes. See the [full API reference](https://docs.easyschematic.live/#/api) for additional endpoints.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/` — deploy as a static site anywhere.

## Self-Hosting with Docker

Run EasySchematic locally with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

This builds the frontend from source and serves it with nginx. Cloud features (save to cloud, device submissions, sharing) still communicate with the hosted API at `api.easyschematic.live` — no account or API key required for read access.

### Docker commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build` | Build the Docker image |
| `make up` | Start the container (port 8080) |
| `make down` | Stop the container |
| `make restart` | Restart the container |
| `make logs` | Tail container logs |
| `make build-clean` | Rebuild with no cache |

Or use `docker compose` directly — the `makefile` is just a convenience wrapper.

### Changing the port

Edit `compose.yml` and change the first number in the port mapping:

```yaml
ports:
  - "3000:80"  # now available at localhost:3000
```

See the [Self-Hosting docs](https://docs.easyschematic.live/self-hosting) for reverse proxy setup and more details.

## Install as Desktop App

EasySchematic can be installed as a standalone app that works offline — no download page, no account, no app store. Just visit [easyschematic.live](https://easyschematic.live) and install from your browser:

- **Chrome / Edge** — click the install icon in the address bar, or Menu → "Install EasySchematic"
- **Safari (macOS Sonoma+)** — File → Add to Dock
- **Safari (iOS / iPadOS)** — Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android** — the browser will prompt you automatically, or Menu → "Install app"

The installed app opens in its own window without browser chrome, works fully offline, and updates automatically when you're back online. All your schematics are saved locally — nothing is lost if you lose your connection.

## Design Principles

1. **AV signal flow, nothing else.** This is a tool for designing audiovisual systems — not a general diagramming app. Every feature decision starts from "does this serve AV workflows?"

2. **Your workflow, your way.** Signal colors, display names, device templates, port layouts — customization is a first-class feature. Different shops work differently, and the tool should adapt to you, not the other way around.

3. **Simple to start, deep to master.** A student can drag devices and draw cables in five minutes. The depth is there when you need it, but it's never in your face on day one.

4. **Automate the tedious, not the creative.** Smart routing, auto-numbering, and sensible defaults handle the grunt work. When the algorithm gets it wrong, manual overrides put you back in control.

5. **Community-built device library.** The shared device database grows because users contribute to it. Submit a template, everyone benefits.
